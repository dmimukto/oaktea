### How to use
"Gambler" is a gambling simulator. Also can be regarded as a gambler's ruin simulator.
The syntax is plain easy to use. Assuming you already have JRE and JDK installed on your device, simply locate the directory where the __Gambler.class__ file is located.
And then enter the command :
```java
java Gambler STAKE GOAL TRIALS
```
Starting off with the initial amount of money, _stake_, a virtual gambler makes a series of $1 bets. The process continues until either the gambler goes broke, or upon reaching the _goal_ amount of money. The number of _trials_ is the number of times the person bets.
At the end of the process, the output is generated as a percentage of times the gambler won and the average number of bets placed.

Some examples :
```
java Gambler 10 20 1000
```
```
java Gambler 50 250 100
```
```
java Gambler 500 2500 100
```

### Health Note
Please do not attempt to gamble in real life. In some religions, it is a sin to gamble. Moreover, gambling has unethical approaches; in gambling, someone ALWAYS LOSES. It is an unfair practise. Almost like stealing or robbing someone else's property.
Promise yourself NEVER to gamble.
